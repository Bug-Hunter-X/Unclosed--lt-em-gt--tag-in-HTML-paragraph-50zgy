This repository demonstrates a common HTML error: an unclosed `<em>` tag.  Unclosed tags can lead to unexpected rendering behavior in browsers, potentially affecting the layout and styling of your webpage. The `bug.html` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.html` provides the corrected version.

## Bug Description
